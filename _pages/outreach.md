For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a scientist. While I wasn’t sure until late high school that astrophysics would be my field, I knew I wanted to pursue a career that would challenge me and give me opportunities to teach and share my love of science. As an LGBTQ+ woman, I am acutely aware of the challenges that come with navigating spaces with limited representation. Growing up, I rarely saw any female scientists in my classrooms and community. This underrepresentation is still present in my life, as I’ve been the only female student in several upper-division physics courses. Instead of discouraging me, this perspective fueled my determination to thrive in astrophysics and become the role model I lacked growing up. My long-time goal is to become a professor of astronomy, where I can both advance our understanding of galaxy evolution and inspire future generations of scientists.

Outside of research and coursework, I am passionate about outreach and scientific education. As a 2024 summer intern at the University of Minnesota’s Bell Museum, I designed and led educational activities for elementary and middle school-aged students focused on astronomy and environmental science. Some of my favorite activities from this internship included using an art project to teach kindergarteners simple machines, and teaching a lesson to eighth graders about the heliocentric solar system. This experience gave me practical experience in communicating complex scientific concepts to a wide range of ages and helped spark my passion for inspiring young learners with a love of science. In preparation for this internship, I received specialized training to effectively engage with autistic, neurodiverse, and special needs students. My focus on accessibility began in high school, where I worked as a licensed personal care assistant and provided companionship and direct assistance to people with mental and physical disabilities. My University of Minnesota internship helped re-ignite this passion for accessibility and supportive communities, which is something I will bring with me into graduate studies.

Throughout the school year, I volunteer regularly within KU’s astronomy and physics department for educational outreach activities. In May 2025, I helped lead an educational astronomy program for students that included exoplanet art and a planetarium show, and in December 2025, I led another outreach opportunity where elementary students were able to come tour the department and learn about the research done by undergraduate and graduate students. Along with volunteer work, I am also working as a teaching assistant for an introductory physics course in fall 2025 and will assist a general physics II course in spring 2026. This opportunity has given me experience in leadership and STEM education that I will use in future outreach throughout graduate school and my future career. 

My efforts towards outreach and inclusive environments are not limited towards STEM fields. In 2023, I designed and led a sanitary products drive for the Minneapolis unhoused population that collected and donated over 1000 items. Additionally, in summer 2025, I virtually volunteered for a youth violence prevention nonprofit based in Kansas City, Kansas, where I analyzed attendance data. Furthermore, throughout the academic year I work as a dance instructor for students aged 4-18+ at two dance studios local to the University of Kansas. In total, teaching dance has allowed me to connect with over 200 students across two states. Through this work, I foster creativity, confidence, and individuality in students from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, which are invaluable skills that will help them throughout their life.
