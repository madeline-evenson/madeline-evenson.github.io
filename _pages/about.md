Welcome! My name is Madeline Evenson (she/her/hers), and I am a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Kansas](https://www.ku.edu) originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota. I am graduating in spring 2026 with Bachelor's of Science degrees in astronomy and physics, along with a minor in dance. I am a member of the KU Galaxies Group conducting research under [Dr. Gregory Rudnick](https://rudnick.ku.edu). I recently submitted graduate school applications, and in graduate school I plan to continue studying observational astrophysics, specifically in galaxy formation and evolution.

My current research focuses on using archival Herschel far-infrared photometry of galaxies within the Virgo Filament Survey to determine the gas and dust contents in galaxies as a function of position within the galaxy. By coupling these measurements with co-spatial SFR measures, I will be able to estimate the gas depletion timescales throughout each sample galaxy and search for signs that galaxy environment modifies the way galaxies form stars.

Along with research, I work as a dance instructor at two dance studios. I am the Director of Competition Dance at [Baldwin City Creative Arts](https://www.bccreativearts.com/), and I also teach technique classes at [Leigh's School of Dance](https://leighs.dance/). Dance has always been an important part of my life, and I recently performed in [*Snap Snap, Begin Again, an improvised performance for Bold Women*](https://calendar.ku.edu/event/snap-snap-begin-again-an-improvised-performance-for-bold-women).

Outside of academics and dance, I am passinate about educational outreach (further discussed in [Outreach](https://madeline-evenson.github.io/outreach/), music, and reading. In my free time, I love to attend concerts, go thrifting with friends, and spend time with my cat, Agatha.
