My name is Madeline Evenson and I am a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Kansas](https://www.ku.edu) in the [Dept. of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.ku.edu). I'm double-majoring in astronomy and physics, along with minoring in dance. I am a member of the KU Galaxies Group working under [Dr. Gregory Rudnick](https://rudnick.ku.edu).

My current research focuses on calculating photometry measurements of galaxies within the Virgo Filament Survey (VFS) and using these measurements to determine how dust emissions affect galaxy properties and their environments.
