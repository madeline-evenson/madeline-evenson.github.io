My name is Madeline Evenson, and I am a senior undergraduate student at the [University of Kansas](https://www.ku.edu) in the [Dept. of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.ku.edu). I will be graduating in spring 2026 with Bachelor's of Science in astronomy and physics, along with a minor in dance. I am a member of the KU Galaxies Group working under [Dr. Gregory Rudnick](https://rudnick.ku.edu).

My current research focuses on using archival Herschel far-infrared photometry of galaxies within the Virgo Filament Survey to determine the gas and dust contents in galaxies as a function of position within the galaxy. By coupling these measurements with co-spatial SFR measures, I will be able to estimate the gas depletion timescales throughout each sample galaxy and search for signs that galaxy environment modifies the way galaxies form stars.
